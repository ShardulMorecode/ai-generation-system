#AI Image and Video Generation System
Description
This project is an AI-powered application that generates images and videos based on text prompts. It leverages Stable Diffusion for image generation and integrates with Flask to provide a user-friendly interface. Users can log in, generate content, and view it in a gallery.

Features
AI Image Generation: Generate high-quality images based on user-provided prompts.
AI Video Generation: Create short videos by stitching generated images together.
User Interface: A simple and intuitive interface for logging in and browsing generated content.
Technology Stack: Python, Flask, Stable Diffusion, FFmpeg, HTML/CSS.
